The Image-Based Authenticator is a mini project designed to enhance user authentication through visual recognition. By requiring users to select the correct image from a set of options, this system offers a more engaging and secure alternative to traditional password-based authentication.

Objectives User Engagement: Utilizing images makes the authentication process interactive and user-friendly. Enhanced Security: Visual recognition can help mitigate risks associated with password theft or brute-force attacks. Accessibility: Users can authenticate without relying solely on text-based passwords, accommodating diverse user needs. DATASET(TESS):The dataset for the Image-Based Authenticator consists of images used for user authentication. Each set of images should include a target image (the correct choice) and several distractor images (incorrect choices). Consider using diverse categories to make the authentication process engaging. Examples include:

Animals: Cats, dogs, birds, etc. Nature: Trees, mountains, flowers, etc. Objects: Cars, furniture, electronics, etc. Food: Fruits, dishes, beverages, etc.
